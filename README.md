# Data-Structures
The objective of this course is to introduce abstract data structures, including, but not limited to, arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, trees, and graphs. The course also aims to give a conceptual understanding of the trade-offs between various data structures, and concepts of algorithmic design, recursion, and a variety of searching and sorting algorithms.
